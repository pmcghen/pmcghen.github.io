<h1>Firefox DevTools Bug 1743334</h1>

<p>
  I'm a big believer in open source software, so this was an opportunity to not
  only work on new and existing skills, but also contribute to a project that
  means a lot to me.
</p>
<p>
  The issue I identified for my first contribution was a bug that was causing
  Android user agent strings to disply the incorrect information in the
  responsive mode device list in DevTools. The team at Mozilla helped me learn
  their Mercurial version control strategy and their automated build process.
  It was a great opportunity to see how a large scale software project works
  and gave me the chance to learn some new workflows. I really enjoyed this
  experience and I look forward to many more open source contributions in the
  future!
